# A Blog Starter App

This is a trivial blog app, started with Vite.

It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.
Made by me Daniel Ruskin


link: https://basic-blog-eff3d.firebaseapp.com/  hopefully that works
my normal web app without the firebaseapp part doesnt work. It did before then it starting bugging and stopped working
Also IT DOESNT SHOW MY NEW CHANGES AFTER THE INITIAL FIREBASE DEPLOY ON THE WEBSITE AND ITS SENDING ME INSANE, PLEASE BELIEVE ME THAT THE CSS HAS CHANGED OR CHECK THE LOCAL HOST PAGE. I HAVE SPENT SO LONG TRYING TO FIX IT AND IM SCARED IT MIGHT BREAK IF I TRY SOMETHING ELSE.
